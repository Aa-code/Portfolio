    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>As an Inspiring Web dev, I didn't always have a passion for code. Before General Assembly I had no idea about coding. I grew up playing sports all my life and through sports I connected with others and thrived off pushing my teammates to do their very best. I hope to bring this passion and thrive into my work,  building a project with a team is the best, because along the way you are motivating one another and learning as well. I love photography and enjoy taking beautiful photos. I also enjoy hiking and running.</p>
